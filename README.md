Hello everyone!

It's a simple script, with which you can determine location of ip.

It searches for ip in db - please, import it (structure and data you can find in sql.txt)

If you want to make search faster - consider on creating indexes. 

Use this code as you want, if you have any suggestions on how to improve it - I will be pleased to hear them out!
